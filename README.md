Project Title: SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SOLUTION FOR TECH PARK
Tools: Power BI for visualization, Python for data manipulation.
Dataset Creation: Created a comprehensive dataset capturing tenant-specific data, building characteristics, and weather conditions, overcoming the lack of publicly available datasets for tech park settings.
Data Processing: worked on cleaning and preprocessing 10 years of tenant data, including handling missing values and ensuring correct data types.
Predictive Analytics: Utilized LightGBM Regression to build a predictive model capable of accurately forecasting electricity consumption for individual tenants, considering factors like industry type, acquired area, and employee count.
Model Optimization: Employed cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to enhance the model's accuracy and prevent overfitting, achieving a high R-squared score and low MSE.
Dashboard Development: In the process of developing interactive dashboards using Power BI to provide insights into tenant metrics, electricity consumption, and employee statistics. Projected tenant wise prediction on Dashboard.
